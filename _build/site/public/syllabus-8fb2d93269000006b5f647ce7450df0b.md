## Grading Policy

**Course Format:**

- Synchronous in-person lectures are each Tuesdays and Thursday, 5:30pm-6:45pm at North 1001E
<!-- - Individual programming assignments and (optional) cumulative project -->
- Midterm examination during lecture and final examination during the registrar-assigned time slot during finals week

**Expectations:**

Completing homework is an essential part of the learning experience. Students are expected to learn both the material covered in class and the material in the textbook and other assigned reading.

**Honor Code:**

You are encouraged to work together on the overall design of the programs and homework. However, for specific programs and homework assignments, all work must be **your own**. As a general rule, do your own typing. Submitting work of others, or not safeguarding your work from copying, are academic integrity violations. You are responsible for knowing and following Hunter College's [Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentaffairs/student-conduct/academic-integrity/welcome-academic-integrity/?searchterm=integrity):

> Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures. All incidents of cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct in the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students office.

**Lecture Participation:**

Participation in lecture is measured by collected classwork. If you miss or do poorly on a classwork, your grade on the final exam will replace the missing or low grade.

**Programming Assignments:**

- Assignments are posted on the class website, usually two weeks before the due date. They reinforce concepts covered in lecture and lab and serve as building blocks for the classwork and the semester-long project.
- To receive full credit for a program, the program must perform correctly, must include comments, be written in good style (following [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), using [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/)), and be submitted via [Gradescope](http://www.gradescope.com/).
- While you may consult and discuss with others, this is an individual assignment, and all code must be written and typed by you. All programs are run through [similarity review](https://help.gradescope.com/article/3vr6x46ppn-instructor-assignment-programming-code-similarity) and copied code is reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
<!-- - To encourage starting early on assignments, bonus points are available for submitting the programming assignments early ([more details](https://stjohn.github.io/datasci/fall23/work.html#hw)). -->
- No late homework is accepted. Instead, we drop the lowest programming assignment grade when computing the final programming grade.


**Midterm Examination:**
<!-- **Project:** There is a 2-part exam consisting of written and coding questions: -->
<!-- There is a 2-part exam consisting of written and coding questions:-->

<!-- - Thursday, 23 October: 9:00am-11:15am -->

The midterm covers material from the lecture notes, code demonstrations, classwork, and submitted programs. There is no make-up midterm examination. Instead, your score on the final exam will replace missing midterm grades (the final exam grade will also replace the midterm grade if you earn a higher grade on the final than the midterm). 

**Final Exam:**
There is a 2-part exam consisting of written and coding questions:

Coding exam will be given either during finals week or the last week of class. It is a case-study style exam where you will be given a dataset and asked to perform various data science tasks on it within 24 hours. Expectation and rubric will be provided closer to the exam date.

Writing exam: more details to come ...
 <!-- will be given during finals week on the day and time assigned by the registrar.The written final exam is required and is comprehensive, covering all the material of the course. Sample exam questions will be available during the last weeks of the term. -->

**Project**:
A final project is optional for this course. The grade for the project is a combination of grades earned on the milestones (e.g. deadlines during the semester to keep the projects on track) and the overall submitted program. If you choose not to complete the project, your final exam grade will replace its portion of the overall grade. 

<!-- More details can be found on the [project page](project.ipynb).  -->

**Grades:**

- Participation: 10%
- Programming Assignments: 20%
- Optional Project: 25% (if you choose not to do the project, the final exam replaces the grade)
- Exams:
	- Midterm Exam: 20%
	- Final Exam: 25% (or 50% if you choose not to do the optional project)
<!-- - Extra Credit (optional):
  - Up to 5% extra credit can be earned via [pandas 30 days of code challenge](https://leetcode.com/problemset/pandas/)
  - 32 total exercises with premium membership (locked symbol), but for regular free membership, there are 27 exercises available. The total extra credit will be earned by the 27 exercises not 32 questions. -->
  
**Emergencies:**

- Drop the lowest programming grade
- Replace low or missing grades on the midterm, classwork participation and project with your final exam grade

To respect your privacy, there is no need to provide documentation to take advantage of the dropping/replacing grades policies. It is done automatically. See individual sections above for details. If you are going to miss more than 2 weeks of class and associated work, contact us, so we can make arrangements for you to take the course in a future term.
