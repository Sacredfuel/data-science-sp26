    "# EEG Eye State Dataset Case Study\n",
    "The objective of this case study is to explore data handling techniques, particularly for datasets with time-series characteristics and missing values. \n",
    "The [EEG Eye State Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/264/eeg+eye+state) is a collection of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings that capture the brain activity of individuals while their eye states (open or closed) are monitored. This dataset is commonly used in research related to brain-computer interfaces, cognitive science, and machine learning. The duration of measurement is 117 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source**: an [invariant EEG Eye State](../attachments/eeg_eye_state.csv) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delivery Items**:\n",
    "1. Source code (Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts) implementing the tasks outlined below.\n",
    "2. A brief report (Markdown or PDF) summarizing your findings and methodologies in two pages (approximately 1000 words). The report should include:\n",
    "   1. Outputs from each part of the case study (you can copy-paste relevant plots and tables from your code outputs).\n",
    "   2. Which AI/tools assists you used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)\n",
    "   3. Limitations and challenges you faced while using AI\n",
    "      1. Do the tools make mistakes? If so, what kind?\n",
    "      2. How did you verify the correctness of the AI-generated code or suggestions?\n",
    "   4. Ethical considerations when using AI for data science tasks\n",
    "   5. References to any external resources or documentation you consulted."
