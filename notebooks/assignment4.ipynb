    "\n",
    "**Available Libraries**: pandas, datetime, pickle, pytest, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.model\\_selection, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.svm, and core Python 3.6+. (Note if you use our annonations, you should also import Union.)  \n",

    "**Data Sources**:[2021 Yellow Taxi Trip Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2021-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/m6nq-qud6) and [NYC Taxi Zones](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/NYC-Taxi-Zones/8meu-9t5y) from OpenData NYC.  \n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Read in datasets, merging and cleaning as needed.\n",
    "2.  Impute missing values (we will use median for the ordinal values and \"most popular\" for nominal values).\n",
    "3.  Use categorical encoding for qualitative values.\n",
    "4.  Split our dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "5.  Fit a model, or multiple models, to the training dataset.\n",
    "6.  Validate the models using the testing dataset.\n",
    "7.  Develop test suites, using pytest, to ensure that correctness of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify which trips are most likely to cross between boroughs, this program will focus on building several classifiers on both the categorical and numerical features of our dataset.\n",

    "Once you have downloaded some test data sets to your device, the next thing to do is format the data to be usable for analysis. We will need to do some cleaning, as well as imputing missing values and encoding categorical values. Once we have the cleaned the data, we can split it into training and testing data sets. Add the following functions to your Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `import_data(file_name) -> pd.DataFrame:` This function takes as one input parameter:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *   `file_name`: the name of a CSV file containing [2021 Yellow Taxi Trip Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2021-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/m6nq-qud6) from OpenData NYC.\n",

Your function should create k columns, one for each value, labels by the prefix concatenated with the value. The columns should be sorted and the DataFrame restricted to the first k-1 columns returned. For example, if the column contains values: 'Bronx', 'Brooklyn', 'Manhattan', 'Queens', and 'Staten Island', and the `prefix` parameter has the value 'PU\\_' (and set the separators to be the empty string: `prefix_sep=''`), then the resulting columns would be labeled: 'PU\\_Bronx', 'PU\\_Brooklyn', 'PU\\_Manhattan', 'PU\\_Queens', and 'PU\\_Staten Island'. The last one alphabetically is dropped (in this example, 'PU\\_Staten Island') and the DataFrame restricted to the first k-1 columns is returned. \n",
